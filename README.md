# Statistical-Methods-of-Artificial-Intelligence

• Implemented core ML algorithms from scratch using NumPy, including PCA, GMM and Neural network.
• Developed Deep Learning models in PyTorch including Multi-task CNNs, and VAEs for image colorization,
regression, and anomaly detection tasks.
• Utilized techniques such as Fourier Feature mappings for image reconstruction and Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) for foreground detection.
